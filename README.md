# 📚 BrownLLM Notebook README

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook, authored by Ant Greene, is part of the "BrownLLM" repository. It focuses on constructing a sophisticated conversational model using the Brown Corpus, a foundational dataset in natural language processing.

## Objective 🎯
Develop a robust conversational model leveraging the diverse range of text data in the Brown Corpus, demonstrating its versatility in NLP applications.

## Key Steps 🔑
1. **Library Importation**: TensorFlow for neural network models, NLTK for text processing.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Utilize the Brown Corpus with NLTK's tokenization and stopwords filtering.
3. **Model Construction**: Design a sequential neural network with optimized layers for natural language understanding.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Compile and train the model, then assess its conversational capabilities.

## Usage 🚀
- Run each cell sequentially.
- Adjust parameters or inputs as necessary.

## Citation 📖
The Brown Corpus is a widely-used text dataset, created at Brown University in the 1960s. It contains a diverse collection of text samples from a wide range of sources, making it one of the first corpora of English text used for linguistic studies. More information and the original corpus can be found at [Brown University's website](https://www.brown.edu/).
